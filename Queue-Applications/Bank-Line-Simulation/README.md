# Bank Queue Simulation (FIFO Practice)

A C++ console application that demonstrates the implementation of a **Queue** data structure using a Linked List. The project simulates a real-world banking scenario where customers are served based on the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

## 🚀 Features
* **Dynamic Memory:** Implements a custom Linked-List node structure for efficient memory usage.
* **FIFO Logic:** Core queue operations including `enqueue` (joining the line) and `dequeue` (getting served).
* **State Tracking:** Real-time console visualization of the current customer line and the total number of people waiting.

## 💻 Usage
Compile the `main.cpp` file using a standard C++ compiler and run the executable to view the automated bank line simulation.
