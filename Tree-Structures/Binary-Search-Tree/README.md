# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

A clean, object-oriented C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree. This project focuses on efficient memory management and proper class encapsulation.

## 🔑 Core Functionalities
* **Insertion & Deletion:** Handles all cases including nodes with two children.
* **Search:** Iterative search implementation for better performance.
* **Traversal:** In-order traversal to display sorted data.

## 🛠️ Design Choices
* **Encapsulation:** Internal logic is hidden in private helper methods to provide a clean public API.
* **Memory Safety:** Manual memory deallocation in the deletion process to prevent leaks.
